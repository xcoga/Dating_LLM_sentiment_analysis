User 1: Hey there! I just tried out this amazing new recipe for homemade pasta with truffle cream sauce. It was absolutely divine!

User 2: Oh wow, that sounds fantastic! I love truffle anything. I've actually been wanting to learn how to make pasta from scratch. Do you think you could teach me sometime?

User 1: Absolutely! How about we make a cooking class date out of it? I can show you the ropes and we can whip up some delicious dishes together.

User 2: That sounds like a great idea! I would love to learn from you. When were you thinking of doing this cooking class?

User 1: How about next Saturday afternoon? We can spend the whole day cooking up a storm and enjoying our creations together.

User 2: Sounds perfect! I can't wait. Thanks for inviting me to your cooking class date. I'm really looking forward to it.

User 1: It's my pleasure! I'm excited to share my love for cooking with you. See you next Saturday!
