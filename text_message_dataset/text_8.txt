Person 1: "Hey, have you seen the latest news about the political climate in the country? It's getting pretty heated."

Person 2: "Yeah, I know. I can't believe how polarized everything has become. It's like we're living in two different realities."

Person 1: "Exactly! And it's not just politics either. Look at all the social issues that are being brought to the forefront. It's like we're constantly fighting for justice."

Person 2: "Absolutely. But you know what they say, 'the only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.' We have to keep speaking up and fighting for what's right."

Person 1: "I couldn't agree more. Hey, speaking of which, would you like to grab coffee with me sometime? Maybe we can discuss some of these issues further."

Person 2: "I'd love to! How about tomorrow afternoon?"

Person 1:"Sure! I'll se you there!"
