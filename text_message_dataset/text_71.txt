User 1: Hey, have you seen that new movie with the crazy plot twist at the end?

User 2: Yeah, I did! I never saw it coming!

User 1: Right? It totally changed the whole meaning of the movie.

User 2: I love when movies can surprise me like that. It keeps things interesting.

User 1: Totally, we should have a movie marathon sometime and watch all our favorite twisty films.

User 2: That sounds like a great idea! I'm down for a movie marathon anytime.

User 1: Awesome, it's a date then!

User 2: Sounds good to me, I can't wait! Let's plan it soon.
