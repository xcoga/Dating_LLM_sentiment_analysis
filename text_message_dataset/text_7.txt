Alex: Hey Mia, I've noticed we both love reading and discussing books. Would you like to grab coffee with me sometime and talk about our favorite novels?

Mia: That sounds great! I'm always up for a good book chat. When were you thinking of meeting up?

Alex: How about this weekend? There's a new café downtown that I've been wanting to try out.

Mia: That sounds perfect. What time works best for you?

Alex: How about 2 pm? That way we can have some time to chat before the crowds start coming in.

Mia: 2 pm sounds great. I'll meet you at the café. Looking forward to it!
