User 1: Hey, have you checked out the latest birth charts for Virgo and Scorpio? Their compatibility is off the charts!

User 2: Oh really? I didn't know that! I've always found Virgo and Scorpio to be an interesting match.

User 1: Yeah, they have a lot of potential for a strong connection. Hey, want to go on a compatibility test date with me to see if our charts align?

User 2: Haha, that's a creative idea! Sure, why not? Let's see if our stars align as well as Virgo and Scorpio's do.
