User 1: Hey, I noticed we both struggle with our pronunciation in English. Want to practice together sometime?

User 2: Oh, that sounds like a great idea! I could use some help with my accent.

User 1: How about we meet up at a cafe this weekend and take turns reading out loud from a book or an article?

User 2: Sure, that works for me. Let's make it a language exchange date.

User 1: Awesome! I can't wait to practice with you. See you on Saturday then?

User 2: Definitely! Looking forward to it.
