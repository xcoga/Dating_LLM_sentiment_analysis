User 1: Hey, I was thinking we should start a new business together. 

User 2: Oh really? What do you have in mind?

User 1: How about organizing a monthly business networking event for local entrepreneurs?

User 2: That's a great idea! We could bring together professionals from different industries to network and collaborate.

User 1: Exactly! And I was thinking we could kick off our first event next month. How does the 15th sound to you?

User 2: Hmm, unfortunately, I already have plans on the 15th. What about the following week?

User 1: Sure, the 22nd works for me too. Let's make it happen! Cheers to our new startup venture!
