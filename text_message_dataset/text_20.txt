User 2: Oh, hi! I've been to so many places - Singapore, Bali, Thailand, you name it. What about you?

User 1: Oh, I've been to Japan, Australia, and South Africa. I love exploring new cultures and trying new things.

User 2: That's awesome! I love meeting new people and trying new foods. Say, why don't we embark on a journey together? I think we would make great travel buddies.
