User 1: Hey, did you catch that lecture on existentialism yesterday?

User 2: Yeah, it was pretty intense. I always find myself questioning the meaning of life after those talks.

User 1: I know, right? It's like there are no real answers to life's big questions.

User 2: That's what makes it so fascinating. The uncertainty and the unknown can be a bit overwhelming, but it's also what drives us to explore and seek understanding.

User 1: Definitely. It just makes me want to dive deep into these philosophical debates even more.

User 2: Speaking of which, why don't we continue our discussion over dinner sometime? I think it would be interesting to ponder life's mysteries over a meal.

User 1: Really? That sounds great! I'd love to. Let's set a date.

User 2: Awesome! I'll make a reservation at that new Italian place downtown. Can't wait to delve into the meaning of existence over pasta and wine.

User 1: Sounds perfect to me. I'm excited for our existential dinner date.
