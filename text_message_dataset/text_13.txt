User1: Hey, have you checked out the new VR headset that just hit the market?

User2: Yeah, I saw it online. It looks pretty sleek. Have you tried it yet?

User1: Not yet, but I'm planning to grab one soon. Maybe we could try it out together sometime?

User2: Sure, that sounds like fun! We could also test out that new smartwatch I got last week.

User1: Great! It's a date then... uh, I mean, a tech-testing session.

User2: Haha, sounds good to me!
