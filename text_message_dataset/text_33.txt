User 1: Hey, have you heard that new poem by Rupi Kaur? It's so powerful and moving. 

User 2: Oh, I haven't read that one yet. But have you heard of Lang Leav's latest collection? Her words just speak to my soul.

User 1: Yes, Lang Leav is amazing! You know, there's a poetry reading happening at the bookstore downtown next week. Would you like to go together?
