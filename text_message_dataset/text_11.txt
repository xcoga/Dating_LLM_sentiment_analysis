Bookworm 1: "Hey, um, so... I've been thinking. You know how we've discussed countless worlds within books, right?"

Bookworm 2: "Absolutely! It's like diving into different dimensions without leaving your chair."

Bookworm 1: "Well, I was pondering over something a tad different. See, what if... just what if... two characters from different books decided to embark on an adventure together?"

Bookworm 2: "Hmm, that sounds intriguing! Like a crossover fanfiction come to life."

Bookworm 1: "Exactly! So, um, I was wondering... would you be my co-adventurer? Maybe, you know, explore a new chapter together?"

Bookworm 2: blushes "Are you... are you asking me out on a literary escapade?"

Bookworm 1: "Well, in a whimsical, bookish sort of way... yes."

Bookworm 2: smiling "I'd love to. Let's start this chapter together."
