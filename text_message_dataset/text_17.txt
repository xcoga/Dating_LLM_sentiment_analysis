User2: Oh, garlic butter shrimp sounds divine! I've been experimenting with some Thai curry recipes lately. Have you ever tried making it from scratch?

User1: Thai curry, you say? That sounds like a culinary adventure! I'd love to give it a shot sometime. Maybe we could even cook together?

User2: Cook together? That sounds like a fantastic idea! I've been wanting to try some new recipes, and having a fellow foodie by my side would make it even more enjoyable. When would you like to meet up for this tasting session?
