Person 1 (Sophia): Hi... um, sorry to bother you, but I was wondering if you, um, maybe wanted to go grab a coffee with me sometime?

Person 2 (Evan): Oh, hi Sophia! Um, yeah, sure, I'd be up for that.

Sophia: Really? Oh, that's great! Um, how about this Saturday afternoon?

Evan: Yeah, that works for me.

Sophia: Awesome! I'll, uh, see you then?

Evan: Yeah, definitely. Looking forward to it.

Sophia: Me too! Bye!
