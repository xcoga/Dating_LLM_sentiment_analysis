User 1: Hey, have I told you about the time I hiked to the top of Machu Picchu?

User 2: No way, that sounds amazing! I once went scuba diving in the Great Barrier Reef, it was unforgettable.

User 1: Wow, that must have been incredible. We should swap more travel stories sometime.

User 2: Definitely! We could even have a travel-themed movie night, where we watch movies about different exotic destinations.

User 1: That's a great idea! How about we make it a date?

User 2: Oh, I'm flattered, but I think I'll have to pass. Let's just stick to being travel buddies for now. 

User 1: No worries, I totally understand. Travel buddies it is!
