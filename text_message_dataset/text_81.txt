User 1: Hey, have you been to any good concerts lately?

User 2: Oh yeah, I went to see my favorite band last weekend. It was amazing! What about you?

User 1: I haven't been to a concert in ages. I really want to go to a music festival though. Have you been to one before?

User 2: Yeah, I've been to a couple. They're so much fun. You should definitely go to one!

User 1: Actually, I was thinking of going to the music festival next month. Would you like to come with me?

User 2: Oh, really? That sounds like a great idea! I'd love to go with you.

User 1: Awesome! It'll be a date then. I can't wait to jam out to some live music with you.
