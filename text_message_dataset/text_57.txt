User 1: Eh, you know what? I can't stop thinking about adopting another furry friend. 

User 2: Oh, I totally get you! I've been thinking about it too. But it's such a big decision, you know?

User 1: Yeah, for sure. But I think we should definitely go check out the adoption event happening next week. 

User 2: That's a great idea! When is it again?

User 1: It's on Saturday afternoon. We could go together and maybe find the perfect furry companion for ourselves.

User 2: That sounds fun! I'm in. Let's make it a pet adoption date.

User 1: Woohoo! Can't wait. See you there!
