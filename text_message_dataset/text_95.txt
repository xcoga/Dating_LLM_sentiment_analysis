User 1: Hey, I've been thinking about starting a new business. Do you want to brainstorm some ideas together?

User 2: Sure, I'm always up for some brainstorming sessions. What do you have in mind?

User 1: Well, I was thinking about starting a subscription box service for pet owners. We could curate different toys and treats every month.

User 2: That's a great idea! I love pets. Maybe we could also partner with local pet groomers and offer some grooming products in the box too.

User 1: Oh, that's a fantastic addition! It could really set us apart from other subscription box services. Hey, how about we pitch this idea to some potential investors over lunch next week?

User 2: Umm, that sounds good but... are you asking me out on a pitch date?

User 1: Haha, well, I guess I am! It'll be a business lunch, of course. What do you say?

User 2: Alright, I'm in! Let's make it a date then. I'm excited to see where this idea takes us.
