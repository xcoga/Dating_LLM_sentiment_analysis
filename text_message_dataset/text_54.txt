User 1: Hey, I was thinking we should practice some phrases together over coffee or drinks. How about a language exchange date?

User 2: Oh, that sounds like a great idea! I would love to practice with you. When were you thinking?

User 1: How about this Saturday afternoon at the café around the corner?

User 2: Sounds perfect! I'll see you there at 3 pm. Looking forward to it!
