User 1: Hey, have you checked out that new Mexican place downtown?

User 2: Yeah, I heard their tacos are to die for! We should totally go check it out together.

User 1: Definitely! Or we could spice things up and hit up that food truck festival that's happening this weekend. 

User 2: Ooh, I like where your taste buds are going with this. A food truck festival date sounds like a blast!

User 1: Great! It's a date then. I'll pick you up at 6 pm on Saturday.

User 2: Unfortunately, I have a family gathering that day. How about we rain check and plan it for next weekend instead?
