Person 1 (Alex): Hey there! I've been meaning to ask you something.

Person 2 (Jamie): Hi Alex! Sure, what's up?

Alex: Well, I've really enjoyed our conversations lately, and I was wondering if you'd like to go out for dinner with me this Friday?

Jamie: Oh, um, yeah, sure! That sounds nice.

Alex: Great! I'll make reservations at that new sushi place you mentioned liking.

Jamie: Sounds perfect! Looking forward to it.

Alex: Me too! See you on Friday!
