User 1: Hey, have you heard about the upcoming pet adoption event?

User 2: Oh, no I haven't! When is it happening?

User 1: It's going to be on the 15th of next month. I think we should go together and maybe even consider adopting a new furry friend?

User 2: Haha, that sounds like a great idea! I'll check my schedule and let you know if I can make it. Thanks for inviting me!

User 1: No problem at all! Let me know soon so we can plan ahead. Can't wait to see all the dogs and cats looking for their forever homes.
