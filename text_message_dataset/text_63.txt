User 1: Hey, have you signed up for any marathons lately?

User 2: Yeah, I just finished one last month. It was a tough one, but so worth it.

User 1: That's awesome! I've been thinking about doing a charity run soon. Wanna join me for the next one?

User 2: Oh, that sounds like a great idea! I'd love to support a good cause while getting my run on. Let's do it!
