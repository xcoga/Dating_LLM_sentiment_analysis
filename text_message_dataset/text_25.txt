User 1: Hey, I heard you have a new pet! How's your little fur buddy doing?

User 2: Oh, he's doing great! He's getting along really well with the family. How about your pets? 

User 1: They're all good, thanks for asking. I think they would love to meet your new furry friend sometime. Maybe we can arrange a playdate for them?

User 2 (smiling): That sounds like a great idea! Let's definitely set something up soon. My pet would love to make some new friends.
