User 1: Hey dude, have you ever thought about which superhero power you would want to have?

User 2: Oh definitely! I think I would want to have super strength, like Superman. What about you?

User 1: Hmm, I think I would want the ability to teleport, like Nightcrawler. Just think of all the places you could travel to instantly!

User 2: That's true, but I feel like flying would be even cooler. Imagine soaring through the sky like Thor with his hammer.

User 1: Yeah, flying would be pretty awesome too. We should totally continue this debate at the comic convention next month.

User 2: Oh, are you asking me out on a date to the comic convention?

User 1: Haha, maybe I am! It would be a super fun time discussing superhero powers and checking out all the cool costumes together.

User 2: Sounds like a blast! I'm in. Let's geek out over superheroes and maybe grab some lunch too.

User 1: Perfect! I can't wait. It's a date then!
